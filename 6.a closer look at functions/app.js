// passing by value and passing by reference: javascript does not have anything like passing by reference

// FIRST CLASS AND HIGH ORDER FUNCTIONS
// FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS meaning that functions are simply treated as values, in JS functions are just othr types of objects, they are just values meaning we can store them in variables, manipulate them etc., this also means in JS we can pass functions as arguements and return functions, we can also call methods on functions.

// HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION is a function that receives or returns another function
// first class functions and higher order functions are two different things, first class functions meaning a function is a normal citizen and higher order function meaning a function is receiving or returning another function

// 6.FUNCTION ACCEPTING CALLBACK FUNCTIONS

book.call(eurowings, 23, 'Sarah Williams');

//we did not call the book method ourselves, we called the call method which will call the book method with the this keyword set to eurowings, this allows us to set the this keyword manually of the function that we want to call

//what we have been doing all along is manually setting the this keyword, eg book.apply(swiss, flightData); swiss is the manually set this keyword

//we use the spread operator to spread out elements of an array
book.call(swiss, ...flightData);

// 9. THE BIND METHOD
//it also allow us to manually set the this keyword only that it returns a new function instead of immeadiately calling the function

//it is set to whatever value we pass in the bind

// CODING CHALLENGE
// Let's build a simple poll app! A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter 'poll' object below.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The method does 2 things:
// 1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the selected option. The prompt should look like this: What is your favourite programming language? 0: JavaScript 1: Python 2: Rust 3: C++ (Write option number)
//  1.2. Based on the input number, update the 'answers' array property. For example, if the option is 3, increase the value at position 3 of the array by 1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes sense (e.g. answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
//  2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
//  3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1".
//  4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 'registerNewAnswer' method call.
//  5. Bonus: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do not put the arrays in the poll object! So what should the this keyword look like in this situation?
//  Test data for bonus:  Â§ Data 1: [5, 2, 3] Â§ Data 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]
// Hints: Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last section ðŸ˜‰

// GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
const poll = {
  question: 'What is your favourite programming language?',
  options: ['0: JavaScript', '1: Python', '2: Rust', '3:      C++'],
  // This generates [0, 0, 0, 0]. More in the next section!

const runOnce = function () {

// 12.CLOSURES IN JAVASCRIPT
// closures happen automatically in certain situations, we just need to recognize those situations
const secureBooking = function () {
  let passengerCount = 0;

  return function () {
    passengerCount++;
    console.log(`${passengerCount} passengers`);
  };
};
const booker = secureBooking(); //booker is a function as well
booker(); //1 passengers
booker(); //2 passengers
booker(); //3 passengers

// how can the booker function access the passengerCount variable and yet the secureBooking function has finished executing? (it's execution context is no longer in the stack)?
//what makes this possible is a closure
//a closure makes a function remember all the variables that existed at a function's birth
//a function always has access to the variable environment of the execution context in which it was created even after the execution context is gone
//a closure is a variable environment attached to the function, exactly as it was at the time and place the function was created
//A closure gives a function access to all the variables of its parent function even after that parent function has returned.
//A closure makes sure that a function doesn't loose connection to variables that existed at the function's birth place

// 13.MORE CLOSURES EXAMPLES
//we don't need to return a function from another function in oreder to create a closure

  f = function () {
    console.log(b * 2);
  };
};
g();
f(); //46
// reassigning the f function
h();
f();//1554
// inspecting the variable environment of f
console.dir(f)

//a timer is another great example
